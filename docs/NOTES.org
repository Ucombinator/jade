* Maven
** List of all repositories indexed by https://mvnrepository.com/
** Get list of all artifacts in a remote repository
** Detect non-Java

* ASM
** Variable Analysis

* Testing
** OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK
** Other decompiler test suites
** Fuzzing/QuickCheck
*** `javac` fuzzers
** Convergence after 1 vs 2 cycles.

** Success/error levels
*** Unknown failure
*** Setup failure
**** Get Jar
**** Get dependencies
*** Decompile failure
**** ASM failure
*** Decompile succeeded
*** Compile succeeded
*** Equal Signatures
*** Equivalent Method Bodies
    Include information about whether identical or what transformations are
    needed to show that they are equivalent

* Implementation stages
** `class Foo {}`
** Class modifiers
*** interface
*** extends
*** abstract
*** generics
** imports
** fields
** method signatures
** Method Bodies
*** Non-branching
*** Non-looping
*** While loop
*** Do/while loop
*** Loop improvement
**** for (init; test; inc)
**** for (x : expr)

* Special considerations
** Lambda
   Look at Soot.scala for example of how to decode
** Generics
** Synthetics
** Inner and nested classes

* Support levels
** Java Language Level (e.g., as in IntelliJ)
** Class file format version

* TODO/Questions
** include sbt-launch.jar
