Parameter   ACC_FINAL        0x0010 -            Indicates that the formal parameter was declared final.
Parameter   ACC_SYNTHETIC    0x1000 -            Indicates that the formal parameter was not explicitly or implicitly declared in source code, according to the specification of the language in which the source code was written (JLS §13.1). (The formal parameter is an implementation artifact of the compiler which produced this class file.)
Parameter   ACC_MANDATED     0x8000 -            Indicates that the formal parameter was implicitly declared in source code, according to the specification of the language in which the source code was written (JLS §13.1). (The formal parameter is mandated by a language specification, so all compilers for the language must emit it.)

Module      ACC_OPEN         0x0020 -            Indicates that this module is open.
Module      ACC_SYNTHETIC    0x1000 -            Indicates that this module was not explicitly or implicitly declared.
Module      ACC_MANDATED     0x8000 -            Indicates that this module was implicitly declared.

Requires    ACC_TRANSITIVE   0x0020 transitive   Indicates that any module which depends on the current module, implicitly declares a dependence on the module indicated by this entry.
Requires    ACC_STATIC_PHASE 0x0040 -            Indicates that this dependence is mandatory in the static phase, i.e., at compile time, but is optional in the dynamic phase, i.e., at run time.
Requires    ACC_SYNTHETIC    0x1000 -            Indicates that this dependence was not explicitly or implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.
Requires    ACC_MANDATED     0x8000 -            Indicates that this dependence was implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.

Exports     ACC_MANDATED     0x8000 -            Indicates that this export was implicitly declared in the source of the module declaration.
