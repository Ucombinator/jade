# Jade: The Java Decompiler

Jade is a Java decompiler that aims for high reliability through extensive
testing.

The `decompiler` subfolder contains the actual decompiler.
The `maven` subfolder contains code for testing the decompiler against maven.

See the `README.md` files in each of these for details.
